		content => "##lesson4
For this lesson, please do the following:
* Take an array as input, where each element contains someone's name...
** Then, using as many different iteration methods as you know:
*** Print out: 'Hello: %s!' (where %s is the person's name)
**** Do not use any of the literal puppet looping constructs!
***** Try to find at least three different solutions

Bonus:
* Find at least four different solutions to the above problem
* Try doing recursion in puppet

Level 42:
* Write a fibonnacci series `type` (not function) in puppet (without cheating)
** Can you write the standalone version and the puppet master / client version?
* Do the same but for the ackermann function

Happy hacking!\n",
